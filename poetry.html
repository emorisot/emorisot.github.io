  <h1>Poetry</h1>

Open your eyes!

<p>There stood a bridge<br>
And beneath swirling traffic lights<br>
And zooming cars<br>
<br>
It must have been 4 o’clock<br>
One of those days where I trudged home<br>
Across the bridge<br>
<br>
Eyes shut, chin down, head about to burst<br>
I stood dangerously near the edge, a decent fall if I jumped<br>
A fleeting pain and I would be relieved<br>
Of existentialist doubt that grew in my mind<br>
<br>
Who am I?<br>
What is my place in life?<br>
Will I ever find a place in life?<br>
Why live when all that awaits me is void?<br>
<br>
I could imagine, once the Atropos had cut the thread<br>
A graceful waltz with the Reaper as I fell through the air<br>
Enveloped in black and crimson drops pearled on the ground<br>
Curtains! Fin! Applause from Death’s orchestra, I was ready.<br>
<br>
As I swung my hands in the vacuum, I felt a warm breeze<br>
I finally opened my eyes, my jaw dropped<br>
For the warm breeze was none other than Life’s breath<br>
And I could see everything. All at once and all so clearly<br>
<br>
The traffic lights<br>
Mysterious nebulae in mist<br>
A celestial backdrop against falling snow<br>
And yet the cars whizzed by, so indifferent.<br> 
<br>
Tears dewed in my eyes<br>
I had never felt so alive as I stared at the spectacle<br>
For it is only when we trudge, when we whizz by<br>
That we miss ecstatic beauty that colours our life. That gives it meaning.<br>
<br>
We will never truly comprehend anything<br>
You are merely an actor. Witnessing, producing, living beauty<br>
Open your eyes! And be content with that.</p>

<p><b>Velvet hands</b></p>

<p>One winter morning<br>
The raspy fire sizzled in the chimney<br>
Auburn leaves whirled in eddies of wind<br>
<br>
The library where she would sit<br>
A novel on her lap, velvet hands stroking its cover<br>
She smiled, fiddled with my hair<br>
<br>
Read me a story, eyes glimmering<br>
An ecstacy of blond curls<br>
As I ran, giggling<br>
<br>
She put her book away, started knitting<br>
Click, click came the needles<br>
Wool tangled in a frenzy<br>
<br>
Cerulean blue that matched my eyes, she said<br>
“I’ll knit you a scarf, dolly”<br>
Spectacles rested on her wrinkled nose<br>
<br>
As she hummed the tune of a lullaby<br>
The needle dove into the wool<br>
Her icy hands spun all day<br>
<br>
Finally, she held the scarf<br>
Victoriously, tied it around the neck<br>
Of the little girl, cheeks blazing<br>
<br>
It was evening, now<br>
Silver streamed in, the stars blinked<br>
I entered the room, many years later<br>
<br>
I held the scarf, still a delicious blue<br>
The chair was empty, the needles lost<br>
She had tiptoed away into darkness<br>
<br>
The fire<br>
In one last sigh, <br>
Vanished into nothingness.</p>
<br>
Infinite present<br>
<br>
Day and night, night and day<br>
Leaves frolicked to and fro, tickling the ground<br>
Shadows rippled and melted<br>
Men conquered, spent, ate and drank<br>
Every second, every minute, every hour.<br>
Tick tick. One exception to this rule, a hospital, room 43<br>
Where the present is infinite<br>
It was 6:13 when baby Ali was born<br>
It was 6:13 when old Mrs. Warner died <br>
All in room 43. <br>
Tick tick. An ordinary room, immaculate<br><br>
Beds lined against a snow-white wall<br>
A clock, old, no longer ticking<br>
It read 6:13<br>
In room 43, it was always 6:13.<br>
Tick tick. Time happened all at once in room 43<br>
The neolithic age, the Hundred-Year war<br>
All at 6:13<br>
An eternal present<br>
In room 43, all Men are immortal.<br>
Tick tick. One day, the nurse tore the clock down<br>
“Got to replace this useless clock with something that works!”<br>
The spell was broken. Time in room 43 had been betrayed<br>
It was 9:46 and 32 seconds<br>
Then 9:46 and 33 seconds…<br>
It could not be 6:13 forever<br>
All Men in room 43 became vain mortals <br>
The timeless bubble had been burst<br>
Past, present, future<br>
Every second, every minute, every hour. Tick tock. Tick tock.<br>
<br>
The Weeping Gallows<br>
<br>
Every morning, 6 am, Friday<br>
Under my toasty blanket, I stir<br>
Gazing at the ceiling, toes tingling<br>
Every morning, 6 am, Friday <br>
The walk to the row was arduous, pools of time stretched on and on<br>
A wooden voice “Any last words?” <br>
He sighed, for there were too many a word to speak<br>
Too many a memory to keep alive<br>
He remembered the taste of star fruits<br>
And his son’s childish chuckle <br>
And the way his mother’s saree glimmered in the sunlight<br>
Sun ! The sun was rising, golden rays streamed in<br>
But light would die soon, with him<br>
The sagging ceiling would become darkness<br>
The dusty toes would tingle one last time<br>
Curled in bed, I was euphoric<br>
Friday, last day of the working week<br>
Friday, last day of his life<br>
Friday, the gallows wept<br>
Always, at 6 am.<br>
<br>
Joe<br>
<br>
A soldier lay asleep in a sea of mold<br>
Around him, the wind whinged<br>
His fingers were numb with cold<br>
And echoes of gunfire rang in the distance, he cringed<br>
Suddenly muddy blood spurted from his livid lips<br>
He choked, barked, cursed between each rale<br>
Through one eye, an apocalypse<br>
Rotund rats waddled over emaciated corpses<br>
Putrid, fields of flesh and maggot<br>
Eyes closed, he no longer saw, smelt, heard in this ****<br>
He thought of nothing and everything, remembered and forgot<br>
Her name was Melody, wasn’t it? He’d call her Mel<br>
His sister she was, frilly laughs, just turned thirteen<br>
There was also his parents, his grandmother<br>
Grandma Eileen, dear Grandma Eileen<br>
She’d knit a sweater for him, afraid he’d suffer<br>
The chilly night<br>
He showed off his uniform,<br>
They said “Come along, boys! Enlist today”<br>
His sweetheart Margaret blushed at his sight<br>
He boarded the train, a summer day<br>
Children sang and ran along<br>
The glorious fields shimmered in the evening<br>
It was winter now in the field, no children, no song<br>
Men clambered around the firing chorus, enemy shooting<br>
The cement sky wept at Men’s disgrace<br>
Joe -that was his name- his face lit by a blackened Sun<br>
A sad smile stretched across his face.<br>
