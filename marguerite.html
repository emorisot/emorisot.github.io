<p>“This is a marguerite” <br>
Wind waltzing<br>
Bobbing in a sea of fresh green<br>
The flower gleamed in the sunlight <br>
His eyes twinkled in the sunlight <br>
Intently fixed on mine <br>
Warm and loving, against the chilly sky <br>
I smiled, for he adored me<br>
A moment of sheer, utter, complete happiness<br>
I can feel it, I can touch it, I can taste it <br>
Colourful happiness, like a bubble<br>
Ecstatic iridescence<br>
But happiness, like a bubble, is short-lived. <br>
Fresh green turned maroon<br>
The sky, murky marble<br>
The eyes, hard and stormy, no longer twinkled<br>
And yet the flower still gleamed<br>
And it will always gleam, in life like in death <br>
For I will always remember with nostalgia <br>
The autumn of my first love.</p>
