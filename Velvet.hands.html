<p>One winter morning<br>
The raspy fire sizzled in the chimney<br>
Auburn leaves whirled in eddies of wind<br>
<br>
The library where she would sit<br>
A novel on her lap, velvet hands stroking its cover<br>
She smiled, fiddled with my hair<br>
<br>
Read me a story, eyes glimmering<br>
An ecstacy of blond curls<br>
As I ran, giggling<br>
<br>
She put her book away, started knitting<br>
Click, click came the needles<br>
Wool tangled in a frenzy<br>
<br>
Cerulean blue that matched my eyes, she said<br>
“I’ll knit you a scarf, dolly”<br>
Spectacles rested on her wrinkled nose<br>
<br>
As she hummed the tune of a lullaby<br>
The needle dove into the wool<br>
Her icy hands spun all day<br>
<br>
Finally, she held the scarf<br>
Victoriously, tied it around the neck<br>
Of the little girl, cheeks blazing<br>
<br>
It was evening, now<br>
Silver streamed in, the stars blinked<br>
I entered the room, many years later<br>
<br>
I held the scarf, still a delicious blue<br>
The chair was empty, the needles lost<br>
She had tiptoed away into darkness<br>
<br>
The fire<br>
In one last sigh, <br>
Vanished into nothingness.</p>
