<p>There stood a bridge<br>
And beneath swirling traffic lights<br>
And zooming cars<br>
<br>
It must have been 4 o’clock<br>
One of those days where I trudged home<br>
Across the bridge<br>
<br>
Eyes shut, chin down, head about to burst<br>
I stood dangerously near the edge, a decent fall if I jumped<br>
A fleeting pain and I would be relieved<br>
Of existentialist doubt that grew in my mind<br>
<br>
Who am I?<br>
What is my place in life?<br>
Will I ever find a place in life?<br>
Why live when all that awaits me is void?<br>
<br>
I could imagine, once the Atropos had cut the thread<br>
A graceful waltz with the Reaper as I fell through the air<br>
Enveloped in black and crimson drops pearled on the ground<br>
Curtains! Fin! Applause from Death’s orchestra, I was ready.<br>
<br>
As I swung my hands in the vacuum, I felt a warm breeze<br>
I finally opened my eyes, my jaw dropped<br>
For the warm breeze was none other than Life’s breath<br>
And I could see everything. All at once and all so clearly<br>
<br>
The traffic lights<br>
Mysterious nebulae in mist<br>
A celestial backdrop against falling snow<br>
And yet the cars whizzed by, so indifferent.<br> 
<br>
Tears dewed in my eyes<br>
I had never felt so alive as I stared at the spectacle<br>
For it is only when we trudge, when we whizz by<br>
That we miss ecstatic beauty that colours our life. That gives it meaning.<br>
<br>
We will never truly comprehend anything<br>
You are merely an actor. Witnessing, producing, living beauty<br>
Open your eyes! And be content with that.</p>
