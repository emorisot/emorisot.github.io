<p> Dawn rises upon the land of Time <br> 
Silver dewdrops rest on emerald meadows <br>
Ruby coloured robins chant on golden leaves <br>
Electricity and lavender fill the air <br>
A young boy, warm and merry <br>
Guided by Love <br>
He wades through the fields of Time <br>
And despite the hurricanes of anger <br>
The monsoons of sadness <br>
The winds of grief <br>
He wades through the fields of Time </p>

<p> Alas, night sets upon the land of Time <br>
And the paths become difficult to cross <br>
The air is chilly, dark, hostile. Too late to live <br>
“I am an old man now <br>
My skin has become like paper <br>
The emerald meadows are sepia <br>
The ruby coloured robin no longer chants <br>
You have been a wise guide, thank you, <br>
It is time for me to die” he says <br>
Love nods. She knows. <br>
He bids her farewell, disappears into the night </p>

<p>Love climbs on the highest mountain of the land<br>
A star shimmers above, it is warm and merry<br>
She smiles as she awaits Dawn, for the next one<br>
Who will wade with her through the fields of Time.</p>
