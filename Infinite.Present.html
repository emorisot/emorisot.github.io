<p>Day and night, night and day<br>
Leaves frolicked to and fro, tickling the ground<br>
Shadows rippled and melted<br>
Men conquered, spent, ate and drank<br>
Every second, every minute, every hour.<br>
<br>
Tick tick. One exception to this rule, a hospital, room 43<br>
Where the present is infinite<br>
It was 6:13 when baby Ali was born<br>
It was 6:13 when old Mrs. Warner died <br>
All in room 43. <br>
<br>
Tick tick. An ordinary room, immaculate<br>
Beds lined against a snow-white wall<br>
A clock, old, no longer ticking<br>
It read 6:13<br>
In room 43, it was always 6:13.<br>
<br>
Tick tick. Time happened all at once in room 43<br>
The neolithic age, the Hundred-Year war<br>
All at 6:13<br>
An eternal present<br>
In room 43, all Men are immortal.<br>
<br>
Tick tick. One day, the nurse tore the clock down<br>
“Got to replace this useless clock with something that works!”<br>
The spell was broken. Time in room 43 had been betrayed<br>
It was 9:46 and 32 seconds<br>
Then 9:46 and 33 seconds…<br>
<br>
It could not be 6:13 forever<br>
All Men in room 43 became vain mortals<br> 
The timeless bubble had been burst<br>
Past, present, future<br>
Every second, every minute, every hour. Tick tock. Tick tock.</p>
