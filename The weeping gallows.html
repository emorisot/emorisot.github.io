Every morning, 6 am, Friday<br>
Under my toasty blanket, I stir<br>
Gazing at the ceiling, toes tingling<br>
Every morning, 6 am, Friday <br>
The walk to the row was arduous, pools of time stretched on and on<br>
A wooden voice “Any last words?” <br>
He sighed, for there were too many a word to speak<br>
Too many a memory to keep alive<br>
He remembered the taste of star fruits<br>
And his son’s childish chuckle <br>
And the way his mother’s saree glimmered in the sunlight<br>
Sun ! The sun was rising, golden rays streamed in<br>
But light would die soon, with him<br>
The sagging ceiling would become darkness<br>
The dusty toes would tingle one last time<br>
Curled in bed, I was euphoric<br>
Friday, last day of the working week<br>
Friday, last day of his life<br>
Friday, the gallows wept<br>
Always, at 6 am.<br>
<br>
